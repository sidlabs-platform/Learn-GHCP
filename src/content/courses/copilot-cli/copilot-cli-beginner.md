# 🟢 Your First Copilot CLI Session

Welcome! In this beginner course, you'll install GitHub Copilot CLI and have your first AI-powered conversation right in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with Copilot access
- A terminal (macOS Terminal, Windows Terminal, or Linux shell)
- Node.js 20+ installed

## Step 1: Install Copilot CLI

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```

**Expected output:**

```
added 1 package in 2s
```

> 💡 **Troubleshooting:** If you see a permissions error, try `sudo npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli` on macOS/Linux.

## Step 2: Authenticate

Run the following command to log in:

```bash
github-copilot-cli auth
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to authenticate with your GitHub account.

## Step 3: Start an Interactive Session

Launch your first interactive session:

```bash
ghcp
```

You should see a prompt waiting for your input. Try asking:

```
How do I create a new git branch?
```

**Expected output:** Copilot will suggest the `git checkout -b branch-name` command with an explanation.

## Step 4: Try Basic Slash Commands

Inside the interactive session, try these commands:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear the conversation |
| `/model` | Check or switch the AI model |
